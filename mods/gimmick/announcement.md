I've come to make an announcement. Rusted Moss sucks. I'm tired of pretending like the grappling hook is an enjoyable mechanic; it's "unreliable", "finicky", and has "way too high of an effort to actually use properly". I'm tired of pretending like combat is balanced; that weapon range isn't "laughable" and damage isn't "overtuned".

But no longer. As a random internet stranger with zero game development experience, I have taken the liberty to fix your game. You're welcome.

No longer are we shackled by "pointless" and "useless" weapon variety. No longer do you need to choose between "janky" control schemes. No longer are we tormented by "unbeabtable" bosses, hindered from easily crushing them with superior gamer skill because some hack fraud decided to turn hair code into a movement ability.

Introducing Gimmick, or as I call it: Rusted Moss But Good. Simply download it with RMMM, make a new Fern save (speedrun or normal), and unshackle your mind from the prison of the grapple hook. For spoilers, continue reading.

||Happy April Fools! Rusted Moss is really cool, everything above is sarcasm. The mod is real though, so here's the changes:|| ||
- Disables all non-bolt-dispenser weapons (and starts you with it) because no one voted it as their favorite and I'll fix that. Also decreases the reload time by 33%, because otherwise it's way too bad as a solo weapon.
- Replace (most) movement upgrades with additional jumps. Grapple, grapple upgrade (the retraction), shotgun, and rocket launcher all provide extra jumps. The infinite grapple provides infinite jumps.
- Heavy ammo increases the jump power. It's also necessary for movement.
- Added funny dialogue to intro, post-Bonnie, Elfhame entrance, and Froy's summit message. Speedrun mode can't disable it, you must read my writing.
- Replaces the unkillable grapple-only enemies with something else. Made a room in the great climb easier. Removed the entrance to the tutorial (it's not physically possible).||
