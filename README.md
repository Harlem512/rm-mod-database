Data source for [Rusted Moss Mod Manager](https://github.com/Harlem512/rm-mod-manager). Most of these mods can be downloaded in-game, once it's installed.

You can check out my [modding documentation](https://harlem512.github.io/rm-docs/) for information on how this works or how to install RMML. Example mods are included in the `demo` folder.

Here's all the (publicly) included mods and their authors. If an author isn't shown, I (Harlem512) made it.
